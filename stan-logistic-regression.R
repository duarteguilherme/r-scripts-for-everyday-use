### Logistic Models with RStan ###
##################################


# Stan is a modeling language for full Bayesian inference. It uses Hamiltonian 
# Monte Carlo to overcome some issues of Gibbs sampling and is very
# flexible. You can fit any kind of model using its basic framework. 
# The manual has several examples: http://mc-stan.org/manual.html

# Here I present a simple logistic model, borrowing from Pablo Barber√°'s code
# (https://github.com/pablobarbera/quant3materials/blob/master/bayesian/lab13_bayesian_probit.R)
# Since I intended this script to be used by true newbies (like me), it probably has
# more comments than necessary, but it's probably better this way.

# Let's get started!

# How can we run a simple logistic model in Stan?

# If you don't have Stan for R in your computer, uncomment and run the following lines:
# source('http://mc-stan.org/rstan/install.R', echo = TRUE, max.deparse.length = 2000)
# install_rstan()

# Load necessary packages
library(rstan)  # Stan interface for R

# Data set
library(Zelig)
data(turnout)
str(turnout)

# Now we fit a logistic model for several predictors. 
# The model I want to estimate is:
# vote = educate + income + age + age^2 + error, in which vote is a binary variable.
# Age squared is not in the original data set, so it will be created by Stan.
# I assume the same weakly informative prior for the intercept, and a Cauchy
# distribution for the other coefficients.
# I also want to simulate the probability of voting for an individual with the following characteristics:
# educate = 10, income = 15, age = 40 and age^2 = 1600. This is done with the 'generated quantities' block.
# Don't forget the ' at the beginning and end of the function

m1 <- '
data {                          
int<lower=0> N;                # number of observations
int<lower=0,upper=1> vote[N];  # setting the dependent variable (vote) as binary
vector[N] educate;             # independent variable 1
vector[N] income;              # independent variable 2
vector[N] age;                 # independent variable 3

vector[N] age_sq;              # create new variable (4), age squared (no dots in the variable name)

}

beta[1] ~ normal(0,100);       # you can set priors for all betas

# Using coda and ggmcmc to plot graphs

# Plotting some graphs and assessing convergence with the coda package.
# We can convert a fit object to coda with the following function

# I personally like the codamenu() function. It has all tests and plots one may
# want. Just type:
codamenu()
2 # Use an mcmc object
fit.mcmc

# And follow the menu instructions. A Stan fit object can also be transformed into a ggmcmc
# object with ggs(). We can also change the parameters' labels.
# First, we'll remove the y_hat and lp__ columns
fit.mcmc <- fit.mcmc[,1:5]

# Now add labels
