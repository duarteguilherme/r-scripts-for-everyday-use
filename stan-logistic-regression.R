### Logistic Models with RStan ###
##################################


# Stan is a modeling language for full Bayesian inference. It uses Hamiltonian 
# Monte Carlo to overcome some problems inherent in Gibbs sampling and is very
# flexible. You can fit any kind of model using its framework. 
# The manual has several examples, from OLS to complex hierarchical models.
# It can be seen here: http://mc-stan.org/manual.html

# Here I present a simple logistic model, borrowing from Pablo Barber√°'s code
# (https://github.com/danilofreire/quant3materials/blob/master/bayesian/lab13_bayesian_probit.R)
# Since I intended this script to be used by true newbies (like me), it probably has
# more comments than necessary, but I think it's better this way.

# Let's get started!

# How to run a simple logistic model in Stan?

# If you don't have Stan for R in your computer, uncomment and run the following lines:
#source('http://mc-stan.org/rstan/install.R', echo = TRUE, max.deparse.length = 2000)
#install_rstan()

# Load necessary packages
library(rstan)  # Stan interface for R
library(Zelig)  # data set
library(coda)   # mcmc diagnostics 
library(ggmcmc) # mcmc graphs

# Data set
data(turnout)
str(turnout)

# Now we fit a logistic model for several predictors. 
# The model I want to estimate is:
# vote = educate + income + age + age^2 + error, where vote is a binary variable.
# Below I assume the same diffuse prior for all independent variables, a normal 
# distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 100.
# Don't forget the ' at the beginning and end of the function

m1 <- '
data {                          
int<lower=0> N;                # number of observations
int<lower=0,upper=1> vote[N];  # setting the dependent variable (vote) as binary
vector[N] educate;             # independent variable 1
vector[N] income;              # independent variable 2
vector[N] age;                 # independent variable 3
}
transformed data {
vector[N] age_sq;              # create new variable (4), age squared (no dots in the variable name)
age_sq <- age .* age;          # formula for the variable, do not forget the . before multiplication
}
parameters {
vector[5] beta;                # one beta for the intercept, plus 4 for the independent variables
}
model {
beta[1] ~ normal(0,100);       # you can set priors for all betas
beta[2] ~ cauchy(0,2.5);       # if you prefer not to, uniform priors will be used
beta[3] ~ cauchy(0,2.5);
beta[4] ~ cauchy(0,2.5);
beta[5] ~ cauchy(0,2.5);
vote ~ bernoulli_logit(beta[1] + beta[2] * educate + beta[3] * income + beta[4] * age + beta[5] * age_sq); #formula
}
'

# Create a list with the chosen variables
data.list <- list(N = nrow(turnout), vote = turnout$vote, educate = turnout$educate,
                   income = turnout$income, age = turnout$age)
str(data.list)

# Estimate the model
fit <- stan(model_code = m1, data = data.list, iter = 1000, chains = 4)
print(fit, digits = 4)

# Compare with the frequentist estimation
summary(glm(vote ~ educate + income + age + I(age^2), binomial("logit"), turnout))

# Using coda and ggmcmc to plot graphs
library(coda)

# Plotting some graphs and assessing convergence with the coda package.
# We can convert a fit object to coda with the following function
# (http://jeromyanglim.tumblr.com/post/91434443911/how-to-convert-a-stan-fit-object-to-work-with-coda-and)

stan2coda <- function(fit) {
        mcmc.list(lapply(1:ncol(fit), function(x) mcmc(as.array(fit)[,x,])))
}

fit.mcmc <- stan2coda(fit)

# I personally like the codamenu() function. It has all tests and plots one may
# want. Just type:
codamenu()
2 # Use an mcmc object
fit.mcmc

# And follow the menu instructions. A Stan fit object can also be transformed into
# a ggmcmc object with ggs(). We can also change the parameters' labels.
P <- data.frame(Parameter = c("beta[1]", "beta[2]", "beta[3]", "beta[4]", "beta[5]", "lp__"),
                Label = c("Intercept", "Educate", "Income", "Age", "Age Squared", "Log Probability"))
fit.ggmcmc <- ggs(fit, par_labels = P)

# Some plots
ggs_traceplot(fit.ggmcmc) + ggtitle("Trace Plots") + theme_bw()
ggs_density(fit.ggmcmc) + ggtitle("Logistic Estimations for Voter Turnout") + 
        xlab("Estimate") + ylab("Density") + theme_bw()
ggs_caterpillar(fit.ggmcmc) + ggtitle("Coefficient Plot") +
        xlab("HPD") + ylab("Parameter") + theme_bw()


# You may also check Stan's Github repository, it has many examples:
